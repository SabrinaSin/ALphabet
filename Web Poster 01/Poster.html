    <h1> BY A THREAD: SHERIDAN COLLEGE TEXTILES GRADUATE EXHIBITION </h1>
        <h2> Date: April 4 - 17, 2019 </h2>
            <p class="text"> The Textiles Studio in the Craft & Design Program at Sheridan College in Oakville, ON offers an exciting four-year Bachelor program committed to teaching a diverse range of techniques, methods, and training in textiles.  Students engage in a dynamic curriculum through hands-on techniques, materials, and processes through applicable 2D and 3D fibre - specific approaches, while gaining knowledge and exposure in various aspects of textiles through interdisciplinary projects, co-ops, industry visits, field trips, visiting artists, in-depth research, and studio-based work. In addition, students build connections through artistic innovation, skills, and practice, while learning how to initiate an idea from concept to creation. The Textile Museum of Canada is pleased to support textiles students in their development, hosting field trips at the Museum and showcasing the work of graduating students in this exhibition.

     <h1> TEXTILE STORYTELLERS </h1>
        <h2> Date: July 18 – Fall 2019 </h2>
            <p class="text"> Discover the unique stories of four textiles from the Americas – a hooked rug, a quilt, a yarn painting, and a blouse. In an exhibition that will appeal to all ages, visitors are invited to learn more about the cultural traditions related to each textile by reading an accompanying storybook.</p>

    <h1> WILD </h1>
        <h2> Date: October 2, 2019 - March 15, 2020 </h2>
            <p class="text"> 'Wild' features work by five emerging Canadian artists who make mischief of neat and tidy systems of classification. Through a range of textile processes and materials, these artists render fabulous flora and fauna that are defiantly aberrant, untamed, and uncultivated.
            
            Artist: Carrie Allison, Omar Badrin, Catherine Blackburn, Emily Jan, Humboldt Magnussen
            Curated by: Farah Yusuf.</p>

    <h1> TAPESTRY OF SPIRIT: THE TORAH STITCH BY STITCH PROJECT <h1>
        <h2> Date: June 12 – November 17, 2019 </h2>
            <p class="text"> Tapestry of Spirit presents the ambitious and inclusive social project to cross stitch the first five books of the Bible as well as selections from the Scriptures and Qur’an, reflecting on the theme of creation. It is an immersive installation that has been collectively created by almost 1500 volunteers of many faiths, under the artistic leadership of Temma Gentles (Toronto). Visitors will journey through nearly 1000 panels in three languages (Hebrew, Greek and Arabic) including illuminations and embellishments by stitchers from 28 countries who have interpreted these ancient narratives into contemplative, often highly personal expressions.

            The award-winning documentary short film Stitchers: Tapestry of Spirit (directed by Tassie Notar and produced by 90th Parallel) will play throughout the exhibition.</p>
