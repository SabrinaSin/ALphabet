1.	What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? 
</p>

<p>
I think Lialina’s opinion of the word “user” provides a different two perspectives, in reference to Don Norman’s conference announcement, to reduce the use of the term “users”; Don Norman believed that people should not be called users, after all, “We design for people; we don’t design for users.” (Norman). In the narrative, Lialina then addresses the fact that it’s a way for software developers to be reminded that they design for humans and that is a significant factor that needs to be considered in the design and validation development. Lialina, defends several others and their opinions, Lialina also defends the classification of “users”, as it specifies the difference between developers and users. Developers are the individuals who write the software with various functionalities that the activate the software for users to gain access and perform their desired tasks.

2.	What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
</p>

<p>
Based on the reading, Lialina’s ideal internet user are general purpose users, universal users, turing complete users, and creative users. General purpose users are those who are capable of writing articles within emails to clients, publishing photos on the web without using other websites such as Flickr, tweet without opening the Twitter app, even waking up at 7 in the morning without the help of an app. Lialina, also expresses that these types of users could also be classified as universal or turing complete users. Lialina, states, “what I mean are users who have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device.” With that being said, Lialina reminds us that every software/program created, provides multiple functions, as that is how they were designed. For example, Instagram, this app allows you to post, repost content, make videos, go live, interactive with others all around the world, post stories of singular and multiple images without having to use multiple apps. Instagram, allows you to post images without actually being in the app. You can edit your photos in other apps such as Snapseed, and directly post the image to Instagram, without opening the Instagram app. Lastly, creative users, are those who are able to view designs using different perspectives, conduct quality research and state clear objectives.

3.	From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?
</p>

<p>	
As a designer who interacts with the web on a daily basis, some "gaps that can be filled by users”, are basic billing and shipping information when making purchases online, posting content on social media and creating personal websites.
